## Epidemiological contagion simulation

Epidemiologists use mathematical models to understand how diseases spread throughout a population. [Dr. James Stock](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Vu0wl-9K2dh8MpMqaO85MvE6UH7gcRLx/view) offers a simplified model based on more complicated epi. models, which I have been inspired to simulate.
